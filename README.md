## Inspiration
Traveling is now a thing! and everyone wants to get out the house after being locked up for MONTHS to explore. However, precautions must be taken when looking to explore options. Persons would love for easy easy access to information about whats open, protocols to follow and max of persons allowed.

## What it does
Our messenger chatbot will provide realtime Covid updates for persons wanting to know what is the latest news in the region.  It will provide persons with information about their favorite places that have resumed operations during pandemic along with:
where is open, new operational times, protocols observed, curfew times and more!
